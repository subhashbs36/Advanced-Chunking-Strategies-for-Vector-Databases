    "Greg Kamradt popularized what's known as the semantic chunker with his [5 Levels of Text Splitting](https://github.com/FullStackRetrieval-com/RetrievalTutorials/blob/main/tutorials/LevelsOfTextSplitting/5_Levels_Of_Text_Splitting.ipynb) notebook here which takes a different approach from fixed character/token chunking. Instead of splitting text at predetermined positions or separators, it uses embeddings to find natural semantic boundaries in the text while maintaining consistent chunk sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chroma modified the algorithm to provide better size control through binary search. The chunker first splits text into small fixed-size pieces (around 50 tokens) using standard recursive splitting with separators. For each piece, it looks at surrounding context (3 segments before and after) to understand the local meaning - this helps maintain semantic coherence across potential split points.\n",
    "\n",
    "After embedding these contextualized pieces, it calculates cosine distances between consecutive segments. Higher distances suggest natural topic transitions that make good splitting points. But rather than using Kamradt's original fixed percentile approach for choosing split points, Chroma's version uses binary search to find a similarity threshold that produces chunks close to the target size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary search starts with limits of 0.0 and 1.0, calculating the midpoint threshold and counting how many splits it would create. If there are too many splits, it raises the threshold by adjusting the lower limit; too few splits, it lowers the threshold by adjusting the upper limit. This continues until it finds a threshold that creates chunks of approximately the desired size.\n",
    "\n",
    "This modification makes the chunker more practical by balancing semantic coherence with consistent chunk sizes. While the original version could produce unpredictably large chunks, the modified version maintains better size control while still respecting natural topic boundaries in the text."

    "The ClusterSemanticChunker takes a **global optimization** approach to chunking, contrasting with kamradt's **local decisions** about split points. Rather than looking through a sliding window of context, it considers relationships between all pieces of text simultaneously to find the most semantically coherent groupings while maintaining size constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process begins similar to other chunkers by splitting text into small fixed-size pieces (defaulting to around 50 tokens) using standard recursive splitting. However, instead of only analyzing consecutive pieces, it creates a similarity matrix by embedding each piece and calculating cosine similarities between all possible pairs. This gives the chunker a complete view of semantic relationships throughout the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this similarity matrix, the chunker employs dynamic programming to find the optimal way to group pieces into chunks. For each position in the text, it tries different possible chunk sizes and calculates a \"reward\" based on the total semantic similarity between all pieces within that potential chunk. By building up from small pieces and saving intermediate results, it efficiently explores the space of possible chunkings to find a global optimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size constraints are enforced by limiting the maximum number of pieces that can be combined into a chunk (max_cluster). Within this limit, the algorithm is free to create chunks that maximize semantic coherence. This leads to more natural groupings than approaches that only look at local context, as it can recognize when pieces far apart in the text are actually closely related.\n",
    "\n",
    "This global optimization strategy helps avoid some common pitfalls of sliding window approaches. While local methods might miss opportunities to group related content that's separated by a brief topic shift, the cluster approach can see these relationships in its similarity matrix. The result is chunks that more accurately reflect the semantic structure of the document while still maintaining practical size limits for downstream processing."

    "The LLM Semantic Chunker takes a direct approach to document chunking by literally asking a Language Model to identify semantic boundaries. The process begins by dividing the input text into small, fixed-size pieces of around 50 tokens using a standard recursive splitter, creating manageable units for the LLM to analyze. These pieces are then wrapped with special tags like `<start_chunk_1>` and `<end_chunk_1>` to maintain their identity throughout the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the chunking process involves presenting text to the LLM in windows of approximately 800 tokens (containing multiple small pieces) at a time. For each window, the LLM is instructed to identify natural semantic breaks, responding in a specific format like `split_after: X, Y, Z` where X, Y, Z are chunk numbers. These splits must be in ascending order and must start from the current position, with at least one split being required to ensure the process continues moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chunker maintains a sliding window approach, progressively moving through the document based on the LLM's last suggested split point. This continues until either the end of the document is reached or the remaining text becomes too short to require further splitting (less than ~4 chunks).

    "- Higher values are better for all metrics\n",
    "- This token-level evaluation approach differs from traditional IR metrics which focus on document-level relevance and ranking, making it more suitable for evaluating RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems.\n",
    "- They capture not just whether relevant information was retrieved but also how efficiently (how many irrelevant tokens were included)\n",
    "- IoU penalizes both missing relevant tokens and including irrelevant ones, making it a good overall measure of chunking efficiency\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Best Overall Performance**:\n",
    "- The ClusterSemanticChunker with 400 tokens achieved the second-highest recall (91.3%) while maintaining decent efficiency\n",
    "- The LLMSemanticChunker achieved the highest recall (91.9%) with average efficiency metrics\n",
    "- The ClusterSemanticChunker with 200 tokens achieved the highest precision (8.0%), PrecisionΩ (34.0%), and IoU (8.0%)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Practical Recommendations**:\n",
    "- The RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with chunk size 200 and no overlap performs consistently well across all metrics (88.1% recall, 7.0% precision, 29.9% PrecisionΩ)\n",
    "- This is significant because it's a simpler, more commonly available method\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Important Findings**:\n",
    "- Reducing chunk overlap generally improves IoU scores by reducing redundant information\n",
    "- OpenAI's default settings (800 tokens with 400 overlap) resulted in below-average recall and the lowest scores across other metrics\n",
    "- Smaller chunk sizes (200-400 tokens) generally performed better than larger ones (800 tokens)\n",
    "- Adding overlap between chunks generally decreased efficiency metrics while only marginally improving recall\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Surprising Results**:\n",
    "- The simple RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter performed competitively with more sophisticated semantic approaches\n",
    "- The default settings for popular chunking strategies (like OpenAI's) were suboptimal\n",
    "- The LLM-based chunker performed well despite its simplicity\n",
    "\n",
    "If implementing a RAG system today, **this suggests that you should either**:\n",
    "1. Use RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter with 200-400 token chunks and no overlap for a simple, effective solution\n",
